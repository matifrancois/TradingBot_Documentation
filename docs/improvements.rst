Upcoming Improvements
---------------------

Going forward, these improvements could be implemented:

.. raw:: html

   <ul>
   <li>

Allowing visualization of all arbitrage strategies available for each
maturity date and not just the best optiont.

.. raw:: html

   </li>
   <li>

Implementing different types of arbitrage possible, to widen the scope
of possibilities for action against future prices.

.. raw:: html

   </li>
   <li>

Change the data loading procedure at the beginning of the program.
Currently, for each future we want to look at, we load its maturity date
and that takes longer than just retrieving all data and then filtering
locally.

.. raw:: html

   </li>
   <li>

Implementing the possibility of looking at all future prices in a chart.
This data is already in a dictionary, so all that's left is to show that
in the console if selected in the main menu.

.. raw:: html

   </li>
   </ul>
