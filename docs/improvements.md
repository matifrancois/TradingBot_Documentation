## Upcoming Improvements

Going forward, these improvements could be implemented:

<ul>
<li>Allowing visualization of all arbitrage strategies available for each maturity date and not just the best optiont.</li>
<li>Implementing different types of arbitrage possible, to widen the scope of possibilities for action against future prices.</li>
<li>Change the data loading procedure at the beginning of the program. Currently, for each future we want to look at, we load its maturity date and that takes longer than just retrieving all data and then filtering locally.</li>
<li>Implementing the possibility of looking at all future prices in a chart. This data is already in a dictionary, so all that's left is to show that in the console if selected in the main menu.</li>
</ul>
